 BRK_zacata_felis_desc:0 "§YBorn 26TE, 13HTE§!\n\nZacata's life was that of a fraught one, created in Sondor as an experiment by someone only going by the name 'Third Elder,' then after getting involved with a mercenary group fled to the island of Hermonia, where he was cared for by the then Queen Mileana of Hermonia. It was here that he founded the Felis line, newer than Mileana's 'Faena' line of House Hermonia.\n\nAfter Mileana had decided that the pressure of being a Queen was too much for her kindly nature, in 52TE she adopted Zacata and abdicated the throne for him to become the new King of Brenra, first male of the line for decades. Now he has the pressure of rulership placed on him, and pressure in three ways now recently come to him.\n\nThe first, of his adoptive Mother, though subtle, she is in favour of modernising in favour of the free market. The second, of an advisor named Amora Hermona, in favour of an egalitarian she calls 'Xonaise;' Communism, one of Floristanite type. The third, of another advisor named Elizabeth Mápíca, in favour of a stronger authority, the primacy of the 'Brenran Race' and the primacy of women."

 RAZ_bashar_razud_desc:0 "First born of the first Sultan Salan Razud, Bashar inherited a land recently united by conquest and diplomacy. However the coming tension of the world would interrupt the isolation this nation until now had come to, and it is up to him to decide how he will look at the outer world.\n\nTo his east Bashar sees an isolated tribe of people formerly living on the land now Razuni, the island of Hermonia, possibly to become another tribe supplanted by the Sultanate. However he must also face other emerging ideology, such as that of socialism, capitalism, and nationalism. Whether Razuni survives his reign is up to him and his court."
