 #The Coming War
 COMING_WAR_NAME:0 "The Coming War"
 COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "The world of Eldham has recently reeled back from a great war against the Ellysian Empire, managing to cull some of its land away, lessening the imperialistic impact the nation has. However, this peace will not last for long, as rumours come out of bigotry within this Ellysian Empire, the world now sees that war must come again."
 
 ##Majors
 USE_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "The United Socialist States of Eldham though founded recently sw itself has a sizeable population and large piece of land in the south-east of Eldham. With the recent death of Aboniert Ormnidus, Leo Belgicus came out on top following a brief sucession crisis and must now face rising tensions between the USSE and the northern nation of Ellysia."
 ELY_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "The Ellysian Empire as it stands reels back from the First Coalition-Ellysian War, which had resulted in its isolation to the north-east of Eldham. However though, shocking that first Coalition, the Empire stood merely bruised in ego and reputation, as it remains the single largest nation on Eldham. But that soon will change."
 
 ##Minors
 BRK_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Brenra for centuries has laid within its own island, believing itself the last bastion of a destroyed world. However, the recent arrival of their now King Zacata Felis has shown them that there is a world beyond. Now Zacata faces a problem in leadership, he must modernise the nation whilst maintaining the balance in leadership."
 RAZ_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "It was only a few years that the Razuni Sultanate was given its second Sultan by the name of Bashar Razud, and even more recent that they had acquired their native religion of Salranism. This sultanate however wishes still to claim itself a grand nation, even if not by conquest, then by culture."
 FAR_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Farencia-Bellum was trapped, with the defeat of Ellysia in the First Coalition-Ellysian War, the Empire had moved to surround Farencia-Bellum, locking the Farencians in the mountains around Vultas. The Kingdom thus was poised to liberate itself from this forced surrounding of lands, and would take the first chance it had to do so."

 OTHER_COMING_WAR_DESC:0 "Other nations seek to expand their power, gain money, or otherwise survive in the world that is Eldham, how they may do so will depend on their location, culture, religion and people."

 #End of Ellysia
 ELLYSIA_END_NAME:0 "End of Ellysia"
 ELLYSIA_END_DESC:0 "The corpse of Ellysia lies rotted and partitioned between the powers of and around the Second Coalition. While some 'Neo-Ellysian' seperatist groups lay within the land, they bear no legitimacy to the control of its former territories in the eyes of the prior victors. Now comes a period of rest in which those five administrative zones will be split further into fully independent nations..."
